echo "   1. Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser"
echo "   2. Log in with your credentials"
echo "   3. Send a message"
echo "   4. Watch for the 'In streaming...' badge"

echo "💡 Debugging tips:"
echo "   - Open browser DevTools (F12)"
echo "   - Go to Console tab to see streaming logs"
echo "   - Go to Network tab to see /api/chat/stream requests"
echo "   - Click on the stream request to see SSE events"
